site-rebuild
============

Site Rebuild project for CodeFellows Foundation Class - apple.com

This project creates a Semantic HTML 5 outline of the current apple.com website.

There are three main sections:
* A header containing a navigation bar
* A main section containing a focal heading and four smaller sub headings, which I've created as articles
* A footer containing another navigation bar and some additional information including copyright info

I made use of:
* https://gsnedders.html5.org/outliner - to test my structure
* and of course apple.com
